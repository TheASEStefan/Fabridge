# Fabridge
Fabridge is a core mod that does stuff on Forge with the trick that it works like Fabric. It can be useful for certain events and much more, you can sync the client and the server this way without doing too much, and then writing values that will later on be saved on both the client and the server. It also comes with custom events and the niche ability to register stuff elsewhere which is also possible on the classic forge, but with this it's exactly like you would do it on fabric. It's very useful for people that want to port a mod from fabric to forge as well.

It's mainly used in our projects that are based on some Fabric code, even though they are on Forge, weird conception I know.

This was originally designed for our gun system, but any dev can implement it into their project by going to their build.gradle and pasting in the maven source of any version.
